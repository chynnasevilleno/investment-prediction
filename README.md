# investment-prediction
This application predicts whether you should buy or sell your stocks given a set of parameters, specifically, trading volume, change in percent, opening price and closing price difference, and highest price and lowest price difference. The model was built using scikit-learn and we used the SVC algorithm to generate 71% accuracy.
